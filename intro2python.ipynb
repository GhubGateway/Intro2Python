    "Welcome to the Intro2Python Repository! This resource is designed to help you grasp the basics of the python programming language and apply geological data analysis. Whether you're a student, a professional, or someone interested in seeing how python can be used to make tasks easier, this repository provides a comprehensive introduction to Python tailored to your needs.\n",

    "**Before you begin:** there are many IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) available to develop python code (tools, workflows, analyses, interfaces, etc) including [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), and the IDE we use at Ghub, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). If you have a preferred IDE that you use on your own personal computer, you can simply clone this repository using the command below (see \"Getting Started\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, ***if you would like to use Ghub's built-in development environment linked to your personal Ghub account*** (which is what we recommend for folks just starting out), first log in to your Ghub account and then launch either the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://theghub.org/resources?alias=jupyter6deb10) tool in Ghub or the [Jupyter Lab](https://theghub.org/resources/4913) tool, both of which will direct you to your personalized virtual environment on Ghub (note: both tools accomplish the same thing, the main difference is simply the user interface layout, so go with whichever one you like the best).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the instructions in the initial slides (Presentation 0), clone the Intro2Python Repository (see command in the \"Getting Started\" section below) into your own environment. The Intro2Python tool hosted on Ghub is not editable (i.e., you can make changes while it's open but those changes won't be saved), so we recommend bringing a copy of the tool into your own environment so you can save your edits to the code as you go through the exercises."
